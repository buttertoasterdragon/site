<h1>Experimental?</h1>
<p>Still learning a lot about how HTML works. For that, the <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/'>MDN Web Docs</a> have been incredibly helpful. Learning CSS seems intimidating, but a helpful person recommended <a href='https://wizardzines.com/zines/css/'>Hell Yes! CSS!</a> by Julia Evans and it seems great! I'll have to buy a copy after I get a few more posts going here.</p>
<p>After spending a lot of time doing not a lot, it's time for me to really get started with internet stuff! Right now, I want to get a few services available on toasterdragon.com:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Private jellyfin server at jelly.toasterdragon.com</li>
  <li>IRC or another chat server at chat.toasterdragon.com</li>
  <li>an internet radio station at radio.toasterdragon.com</li>
  <li>maybe a DCSS webtiles server at crawl.toasterdragon.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Was that an excuse to use the unordered list tag? Yes. None of those services are going to happen yet, I need to figure out a real hosting situation first. I want to self host, but my ISP might be upset about that. Right now, I want to learn HTML and CSS. The next post should be a lot better!</p>
<p>I've added a nav bar, so that's cool. I guess. This stuff is a lot easier than I expected it to be. I'm not sure what I was scared of.</p>
